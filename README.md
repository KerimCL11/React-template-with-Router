# React Router Application Template

## Description

This project serves as a basic template for React applications incorporating routing functionality with React Router. More to avoid creating the same logic over and over again.

## Features

- **Routing with React Router**: Enables smooth navigation between components without page reloads.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: For the nav I just use one from react-bootstrap
- **Clear Project Structure**: Logical organization of files to facilitate project expansion and maintenance.

## File Structure

- `navReact.jsx`: Custom navigation component.
- `About.jsx`: "About" page component.
- `Home.jsx`: Main page component.
- `App.jsx`: Main application component with router setup.
- `main.jsx`: React application entry point, integrating Bootstrap.
